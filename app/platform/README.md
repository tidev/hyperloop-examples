You can place native libraries and frameworks in this directory! Some examples:

  * .framework (iOS)
	* .a (iOS)
	* .aar (Android)
	* .jar (Android)
	* .dll (Windiws)
	
Note: It is recommended to use CocoaPods (iOS) and Gradle (Android) to manage 
larger dependencies on those platforms. For integration, see the `Podfile` and 
`build.gradle` in the root directory of this project.
